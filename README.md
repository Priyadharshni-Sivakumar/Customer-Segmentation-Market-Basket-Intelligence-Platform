#  Customer Segmentation & Market Basket Intelligence Platform

##  Project Overview

This project implements an Unsupervised Machine Learning system to segment customers based on purchasing behavior and engagement patterns. The main goal is to identify hidden patterns in customer data to support personalized marketing strategies and business decision-making.

By applying clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques, this project helps businesses understand customer groups, detect anomalies, and improve marketing effectiveness.

##  Problem Statement

E-commerce companies face several challenges:

- Lack of clear customer segmentation strategy
- High-dimensional customer datasets
- Noise and outliers affecting clustering results
- Difficulty visualizing customer behavior patterns

This project solves these problems using machine learning techniques like clustering, PCA, LDA, and data visualization.

##  Objectives

- Perform customer clustering using:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)
- Detect noise and anomalies in customer data
- Apply dimensionality reduction techniques:
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
  - LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
- Visualize clusters for better understanding
- Generate business-friendly customer insights

##  Algorithms Used

###  K-Means Clustering

- Groups customers into predefined number of clusters.
- Uses distance-based similarity.

###  Hierarchical Clustering

- Creates nested clusters.
- Helps understand relationships between groups.

###  DBSCAN

- Detects dense regions.
- Identifies noise and anomalies automatically.

##  Dimensionality Reduction

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

- Reduces high-dimensional data.
- Improves visualization and clustering performance.

### LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)

- Used with cluster labels for supervised dimensionality reduction.
- Enhances separation between clusters.
